This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",

            "text/markdown": "The **Fear & Greed Index** is a popular market sentiment indicator that attempts to gauge the current mood of investors in the stock market. It's a tool used to understand whether investors are being overly fearful or excessively greedy, which can sometimes signal potential market turning points.\n\nThe index is typically presented on a scale from **0 to 100**, with:\n\n*   **0-25: Extreme Fear**\n*   **25-50: Fear**\n*   **50-75: Greed**\n*   **75-100: Extreme Greed**\n\n**How it Works (Generally):**\n\nWhile the exact methodology can vary slightly between different providers (the most well-known is from CNN Business), the core idea is to combine several market indicators that reflect investor sentiment. These indicators often include:\n\n1.  **Stock Market Strength (Market Momentum):** This looks at the performance of major stock indices. Strong upward trends might suggest greed, while sharp declines could indicate fear.\n2.  **Stock Market Weakness (Market Momentum):** This is the flip side of strength, looking at the number of stocks hitting new 52-week highs versus new 52-week lows. A large number of new highs can signal greed, while a large number of new lows can signal fear.\n3.  **Put and Call Options (Volume):** This examines the trading volume of put options (which bet on a price decline) versus call options (which bet on a price increase). High put volume relative to call volume can indicate fear, while high call volume can suggest greed.\n4.  **Market Volatility (VIX):** The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often called the \"fear index,\" measures expected market volatility. A high VIX generally corresponds with fear, while a low VIX can suggest complacency or greed.\n5.  **Safe-Haven Demand:** This looks at the demand for assets traditionally considered safe havens, like gold or government bonds. Increased demand for safe havens can signal fear, while a shift away from them might indicate greed.\n6.  **Breadth (Advance/Decline Line):** This measures the number of stocks advancing versus declining in a given market. A broad market advance can suggest greed, while a broad decline can indicate fear.\n7.  **News Sentiment:** Some versions of the index analyze news headlines and articles for words associated with fear or greed.\n\n**What the Index Tells Us:**\n\n*   **Extreme Fear (0-25):** When the index is in this range, it suggests that investors are overly pessimistic. This can sometimes be a contrarian buy signal, as fear can push asset prices down to attractive levels.\n*   **Fear (25-50):** This indicates a generally cautious or negative sentiment in the market.\n*   **Greed (50-75):** This suggests that investors are becoming optimistic and may be willing to take on more risk.\n*   **Extreme Greed (75-100):** When the index is in this range, it implies that investors are overly optimistic and potentially euphoric. This can sometimes be a contrarian sell signal, as greed can drive asset prices to unsustainable highs, making them vulnerable to a correction.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Contrarian Indicator:** The Fear & Greed Index is often used as a **contrarian indicator**. This means that extreme readings (either extreme fear or extreme greed) are often interpreted as signals that the market might move in the opposite direction. For example, extreme fear might suggest a buying opportunity, while extreme greed might suggest a selling opportunity.\n*   **Not a Perfect Predictor:** It's crucial to understand that the Fear & Greed Index is **not a perfect predictor of market movements**. It's a sentiment indicator, and sentiment can remain irrational for extended periods.\n*   **Use in Conjunction with Other Tools:** It's best used in conjunction with other fundamental and technical analysis tools rather than as a standalone trading strategy.\n*   **Short-Term Focus:** The index tends to be more focused on short-to-medium-term market sentiment.\n\nIn summary, the Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for understanding the emotional state of the market. By analyzing various indicators, it provides a snapshot of whether investors are driven by fear or greed, which can offer insights into potential market turning points.",

            "text/markdown": "The **Fear & Greed Index** is a tool developed by CNN Business (formerly CNNMoney) that attempts to measure two of the primary emotions that influence investor behavior in the stock market: **fear** and **greed**.\n\nIt's designed to show whether investors are leaning towards being overly optimistic (greedy) or overly pessimistic (fearful) about the market. The idea is that extreme fear can drive stock prices down, creating buying opportunities, while extreme greed can push prices unsustainably high, signaling a potential correction.\n\n### How it Works\n\nThe index is calculated daily and is based on **seven equally-weighted indicators** that measure different aspects of market behavior. Each indicator is scored on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents maximum fear and 100 represents maximum greed. The average of these seven scores gives the overall Fear & Greed Index value.\n\nHere are the seven components:\n\n1.  **Stock Price Momentum:** Measures how much the S&P 500 index deviates from its 125-day moving average.\n    *   *Fear:* S&P 500 significantly below its average.\n    *   *Greed:* S&P 500 significantly above its average.\n\n2.  **Stock Price Strength:** Compares the number of stocks hitting 52-week highs versus 52-week lows on the NYSE.\n    *   *Fear:* Many more lows than highs.\n    *   *Greed:* Many more highs than lows.\n\n3.  **Stock Price Breadth:** Measures the trading volume in advancing stocks versus declining stocks on the NYSE.\n    *   *Fear:* Much more volume in declining stocks.\n    *   *Greed:* Much more volume in advancing stocks.\n\n4.  **Put and Call Options:** Looks at the ratio of put options (bets that a stock will fall) to call options (bets that a stock will rise).\n    *   *Fear:* High demand for puts relative to calls.\n    *   *Greed:* High demand for calls relative to puts.\n\n5.  **Junk Bond Demand:** Measures the spread between yields on investment-grade corporate bonds and junk bonds. A smaller spread indicates investors are more willing to take risks.\n    *   *Fear:* Large spread (investors demand higher compensation for risk).\n    *   *Greed:* Small spread (investors are less concerned about risk).\n\n6.  **Market Volatility:** Uses the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index), often called the \"fear gauge,\" and compares it to its 50-day moving average.\n    *   *Fear:* VIX is high and rising.\n    *   *Greed:* VIX is low and falling.\n\n7.  **Safe Haven Demand:** Compares the performance of stocks versus bonds over the last 20 trading days.\n    *   *Fear:* Bonds significantly outperforming stocks (investors seeking safety).\n    *   *Greed:* Stocks significantly outperforming bonds (investors seeking growth).\n\n### Interpretation of the Index\n\nThe index ranges from 0 to 100, with specific ranges indicating different sentiment levels:\n\n*   **0-25: Extreme Fear**\n*   **26-45: Fear**\n*   **46-54: Neutral**\n*   **55-75: Greed**\n*   **76-100: Extreme Greed**\n\n**The Contrarian View:**\nMany investors use the Fear & Greed Index as a **contrarian indicator**. This means:\n\n*   **When the index shows \"Extreme Fear,\"** it might suggest that investors are overly pessimistic, and the market could be oversold, potentially presenting a good buying opportunity. (As Warren Buffett famously said, \"Be fearful when others are greedy.\")\n*   **When the index shows \"Extreme Greed,\"** it might suggest that investors are overly optimistic, and the market could be overbought, potentially signaling a good time to sell or take profits. (\"Be greedy when others are fearful.\")\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile a useful tool, the Fear & Greed Index has limitations:\n\n*   **Not a crystal ball:** It doesn't predict future market movements with certainty.\n*   **Short-term focus:** It primarily reflects short-term sentiment and doesn't account for long-term fundamental value.\n*   **Can stay extreme:** Markets can remain in states of extreme fear or greed for extended periods.\n*   **One tool among many:** It should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis (fundamental, technical, economic) rather than as a standalone decision-making tool.\n\nIn essence, the Fear & Greed Index provides a quick snapshot of the prevailing emotional temperature of the market, helping investors gauge whether the crowd is leaning towards panic or euphoria.",

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

        "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
